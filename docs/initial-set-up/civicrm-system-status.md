=====================

New in CiviCRM 4.7 is the CiviCRM System Status Screen.  This screen shows you a view of the current status of your CiviCRM installation.

Items in *Red* need to be addressed as soon as possible. An item in red generally indicates something broken that will stop CiviCRM from working normally. 

Items in *Orange* should be addressed as soon as you can and may stop you from completing key CiviCRM tasks.  

Items in *Green* are setup correctly and are on the screen for information only.
